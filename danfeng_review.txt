Mobile app hackathons like Over the Air, held at Bletchley Park, England, can see a large amount of corporate sponsorship and interest.[7][8]

Music Hack Day, a hackathon for music-related software and hardware applications, is a popular event, having been held over 30 times around the world since 2009.[9] Also Music Tech Fest, a three-day interdisciplinary festival for music ideas bringing together musicians with hackers, researchers and industry, features a hackathon.[10] Similarly, Science Hack Day, a hackathon for making things with science, has been held over 45 times in over 15 countries around the world since 2010.[11]

Hackathons have been held to develop applications that run on various mobile device operating systems, such as Android,[12] iOS[13] and MeeGo.[14] Hackathons have also been held to develop video-based applications and computer games.[15] Hackathons where video games are developed are sometimes called game jams.

"TV Hackfest" events have been held in both London[16] and San Francisco,[17] focusing mainly on social television and second screen technologies. In TV Hackfests, challenge briefs are typically submitted by content producers and brands, in the form of broadcast industry metadata or video content, while sponsors supply APIs, SDKs and pre-existing open source software code.[18]

Hackathons have also been used in the life sciences to advance the informatics infrastructure that supports research. The Open Bioinformatics Foundation ran two hackathons for its member projects in 2002 and 2003, and since 2010 has held 2-day "codefests" preceding its annual conference.[19] The National Evolutionary Synthesis Center has co-organized and sponsored hackathons for evolutionary bioinformatics since 2006.[20][21] BioHackathon[22] is an annual event that started in 2008 targeted at advancing standards to enable interoperable bioinformatics tools and Web services. Neuroscientists have also used hackathons to bring developers and scientists together to address issues that range from focusing on a specific information system (e.g., Neurosynth Hackathon[23] and the Allen Brain Atlas Hackathon[24]) and providing reserved time for broad scientific inquiry (e.g., Brainhack),[25] to using specific challenges that focus hacking activity (e.g., HBM Hackathon).[26]

Using a specific programming language, API, or framework[edit]
There have been hackathons devoted to creating applications that use a specific language or framework, like JavaScript,[27] Node.js,[28] HTML5[29] and Ruby on Rails.[30]

Some hackathons focus on applications that make use of the application programming interface, or API, from a single company or data source. Open Hack, an event run publicly by Yahoo! since 2006 (originally known as "Hack Day", then "Open Hack Day"), has focused on usage of the Yahoo! API, in addition to APIs of websites owned by Yahoo!, like Flickr.[31] The company's Open Hack India event in 2012 had over 700 attendees.[32] Google has run similar events for their APIs,[33] as has the travel guide company Lonely Planet.[34]

The website Foursquare notably held a large, global hackathon in 2011, in which over 500 developers at over 30 sites around the world competed to create applications using the Foursquare API.[35] A second Foursquare hackathon, in 2013, had around 200 developers.[36]

For a cause or purpose[edit]

Developers at the 2011 Rewired State "National Hack the Government Day"
There have been a number of hackathons devoted to improving government, and specifically to the cause of open government.[37] One such event, in 2011, was hosted by the United States Congress.[38] Starting in 2012, NASA has been annually hosting the International Space Apps Challenge.

In 2014, the British government and HackerNest ran DementiaHack,[39] the world's first hackathon dedicated to improving the lives of people living with dementia and their caregivers.[40][41] The series continues in 2015, adding the Canadian government and Facebook as major sponsors.[42]

The Global Game Jam, the largest video game development hackathon,[43] often includes optional requirements called 'diversifiers'[44] that aim to promote game accessibility and other causes.

Various hackathons have been held to improve city transit systems.[45] Hackathons aimed at improvements to city local services are increasing, with one of the London Councils (Hackney) creating a number of successful local solutions on a 2 Day Hackney-thon [46] There have also been a number of hackathons devoted to improving education, including Education Hack Day[47] and on a smaller scale, looking specifically at the challenges of field work based geography education, the Field Studies Council[48] hosted FSCHackday.[49] Random Hacks of Kindness is another popular hackathon, devoted to disaster management and crisis response.[50]

As a tribute or a memorial[edit]
A number of hackathons around the world have been planned in memory of computer programmer and internet activist Aaron Swartz, who died in 2013.[51][52][53][54]

For a demographic group[edit]
Some hackathons are intended only for programmers within a certain demographic group, like teenagers, college students,[1] or women.[55]

Hackathons at colleges have become increasingly popular, in the United States and elsewhere. These are usually annual or semiannual events that are open to college students at all universities. They are often competitive, with awards provided by the University or programming-related sponsors. Many of them are supported by the organization Major League Hacking, which was founded in 2013 to assist with the running of collegiate hackathons.

PennApps at the University of Pennsylvania was the first student-run college hackathon; in 2015 it became the largest college hackathon with its 12th iteration hosting over 2000 people and offering over $60k in prizes.[56][57] The University of Mauritius Computer Club and Hackers.mu organized a Hackathon dubbed "Code Wars" focused on implementing an IETF RFC in Lynx in 2017.[58][59]

Internal company hackathons[edit]
Some companies hold internal hackathons to promote new product innovation by the engineering staff. For example, Facebook's Like button was conceived as part of a hackathon.[60]

Code sprints[edit]
Not to be confused with Scrum (software development) ยง Sprint.
In some hackathons, all work is on a single application, such as an operating system, programming language, or content management system. Such events are often known as "sprints" or "code sprints", and are especially popular for open source software projects, where sprints or hackathons are sometimes the only opportunity for developers to meet face-to-face.[61]

Code sprints typically last from one week to three weeks and often take place near conferences at which most of the team attend. Unlike other hackathons, these events rarely include a competitive element.

Examples of code sprints[edit]
This was pioneered by the Zope, who completed in excess of 30 sprints between January 2002 and January 2006.[62]
The annual hackathon to work on the operating system OpenBSD, held since 1999, is one such event; it was a pioneering hackathon that may have originated the word "hackathon".[citation needed]
Programming languages that have had such hackathons include Perl (for both development[63] and QA[64]), Haskell[65] Scala[66] and the PyPy interpreter for Python..[67]
